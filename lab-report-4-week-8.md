**Week 8 Lab Report**
=====================
- ## Repositories
- [My Repo](https://github.com/pvijay03/markdown-parse)
- [Repo I reviewed](https://github.com/m1ma0314/markdown-parse)
- ## Snippet 1
- Using VSCode's preview, I found the correct parsing and made this test
- ![image](lab4pics\test1.png)
- output from our group's code

- their group's output

- For this snippet, the only issue we had was the extra inclusion of url.com
- this is because our program doesn't recognize `code` tick formatting
- the fix would be pretty easy. We could just detect the ` like we have it doing for the ! in images
- if we find the an open tick, look for a second and then skip to the next open bracket after the second tick
- ## Snippet 2
- here is the test
- ![image](lab4pics\test2.png)
- output from our group
- ![image](lab4pics\us2.png)
- output from group we reviewed
- ![image](lab4pics\them2.png)
- unfortunately, fixing this bug would require a more involved change. Our MarkdownParse has no system for dealing with nested parentheses
- fixing this would require a good bit of code as we saw Joe do in lectures and videos
